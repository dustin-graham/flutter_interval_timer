A neat interval timer

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

This is a sample project I put together for a meetup presentation I did on 5/29/18 at the Phoenix Dart & Flutter meetup group.

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CurToK4lnJx557OqByItbsyr7mNweFzo-rI0jJL-dHo/edit?usp=sharing)

This project is meant to showcase some useful testing practices for developing Flutter applications. I've included Unit, Widget, and Integration tests.
